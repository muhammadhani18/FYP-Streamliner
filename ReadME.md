# Streamliner: The Ultimate FYP management System

The process of managing final year projects is a difficult one. Hundreds of students apply for their final year projects each year. This creates a lot of work for the management, the faculty and even the students themselves. The students need to request project supervisors for their projects, the faculty need to design and approve a list of projects, and the management needs to keep records of their progress. For now, this is done using older management software. There is a need to improve the existing system using new technologies which would allow the process to be streamlined.
